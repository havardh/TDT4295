Software Package
================

Prerequisites
-------------

To build the project the gcc-arm-none-eabi toolchain is needed.

To flash the microcontroller the eACommander tool provided by Energy Micro is needed.It's included in the Simplicity Studio install: http://www.energymicro.com/tools/simplicity-studio
Linux and Mac version is available here: http://forum.energymicro.com/topic/990-simplicity-studio-120-energyaware-tools-osx-linux/

CppUTest must be built.
Run the script in sw/scripts/cpputest to do so.

The rest of the libraries are included in the repository.

Testing
-------

Run `make` from the sw/tests directory.

Building
--------

Run `make` from the sw directory. This should create the file main.bin in the exe folder.

Deploying
------

* Open the eACommander application. 
* Connect to the board. 
* Enter \<root\>/sw/exe/main.bin in the Binary File field on the flash tab.
* Click Flash EFM32.
